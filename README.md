# Template for multilingual jekyll site

## Intention

I was busy converting a number of sites from joomla! to jekyll. Since some of them were multilingual, I was facing the challenge to implement a handy solution for that with jekyll, so I created this template.

## Architecture

For the transation of content, it is handy to have the texts in several languange together in one file, so cross checks can be done easily. 

I decided to keep the whole content in a yaml file (--> \_data/locales.yml)
